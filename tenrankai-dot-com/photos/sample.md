# Sample Photo

This is a sample markdown file describing an image. The image file would be named `sample.jpg` in the same directory.

## Description

This would contain metadata about the photo, including:

- Location where it was taken
- Camera settings
- Story behind the photo
- Any relevant context

The gallery system will automatically load this markdown and render it as HTML alongside the image.
