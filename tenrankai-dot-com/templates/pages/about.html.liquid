    <h2>About Tenrankai</h2>
    
    <section class="about-intro">
        <p>Tenrankai (展覧会) is Japanese for "exhibition" or "gallery show," perfectly capturing the essence of this project as a platform for displaying photographic collections.</p>
        
        <p>Born from the philosophy that content management should be as simple as organizing files in folders, Tenrankai is a gallery, CMS, and blog platform that relies on nothing more than your filesystem. Simply drop files in, or even use <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SyncThing</a> to keep your gallery or website up to date.</p>
        
        <p>Built with Rust for exceptional performance, Tenrankai delivers a fast, flexible, and feature-rich experience without the complexity of traditional database-driven systems.</p>
